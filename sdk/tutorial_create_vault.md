# DAC SDK Tutorial: Create a Secure & Persistent Vault

In this tutorial you will create a secure vault which is encrypted and persisted on the disk. To do that, you'll use the Vault's optional context parameter.

#### Prerequisites

- [NodeJS 12](https://nodejs.org/en/)

#### Step 1. Import SDK

First as always, you need to access the SDK.

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### ** Javascript **

In Typescript you need to use multiple modules from the sdk. Please read more about Typescript modules [here](https://github.com/Internet-of-People/morpheus-ts/tree/master/packages/sdk#Modules).
Here, you only use the Crypto module.

```typescript
import { Crypto } from '@internet-of-people/sdk';
```

#### Step 2. Create a Secure Vault

The SDK provides you multiple tools to protect your wallet:
- an optional **BIP 39** password. It's for [plausible deniability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniability). It's very similar to adding a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)" target="_blank">salt</a> to passwords.
- an encrypt password for encrypting your seed. It's useful if you wish to persist the vault's state as the seed in the state will be encrypted. Hence, to access the seed in various cases it will require you to provide this password as a so called *Unlock Password*. It uses [XChaCha20Poly1305](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-arciszewski-xchacha-03) and it derivates the key from the password with [Argon2i](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2).
- state management.


Below you can observe how you create a secured vault.

#### ** Javascript **

```typescript
import { Crypto } from '@internet-of-people/sdk';

// YOU HAVE TO SAVE IT TO A SAFE PLACE!
const phrase = new Crypto.Bip39('en').generate().phrase;

const vault = Crypto.Vault.create(
  phrase,
  '8qjaX^UNAafDL@!#',
  'encrypt password',
);
```

#### Step 3. Persist State

Now you have a wallet, you possibly want to save its state to disk for future purpose. You can do that easily.

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### ** Javascript **

```typescript
import { Crypto } from '@internet-of-people/sdk';
import { promises as fsAsync } from 'fs';

// YOU HAVE TO SAVE IT TO A SAFE PLACE!
const phrase = new Crypto.Bip39('en').generate().phrase;

const vault = Crypto.Vault.create(
  phrase,
  '8qjaX^UNAafDL@!#',
  'encrypt password',
);

const serializedState = JSON.stringify(vault.save());
await fsAsync.writeFile('secure_storage/vault.state', serializedState);
```

#### Final Step: Loading a secure Vault

You've learnt how to create a secure, persisted vault. But what if you'd like to **load** an already existing vault-state?
It's easy and almost the same.

<p>
    In this example you load the vault's content from the disk into memory.
</p>

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### ** Javascript **

```typescript
import { Crypto } from '@internet-of-people/sdk';
import { promises as fsAsync } from 'fs';

const serializedState = await fsAsync.readFile(
    'secure_storage/vault.state',
    { encoding: 'utf-8' },
);

const vault = Crypto.Vault.load(JSON.parse(serialized));
```

#### Conclusion

Your ðŸ¦„ is happy again. You have an encrypted, BIP39 password protected vault persisted on your safe storage. Congratulations! Don't forget, that if you need more detailed or technical information, visit the SDK's source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/Internet-of-People/morpheus-ts/tree/master/packages/sdk).

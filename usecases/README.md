# Other Possible Use Cases

- Auditable event (concert, performance, sport match) attendance (when the GateKeeper's invalidate action is also public on the chain).
- Lottery bet/draw timestamping.
- Registration/attending/grading of exams at a university.
- Anonymous elections (registration to ballots, casting votes, ballot closing).

> Everything that has to do with timestamping should basically move into it's own section because timestamping on chain is an "unrelated" mechanism to the PKI provided by Morpheus and in my view clutters up the explanations here. I agree though that it is an absolutely awesome feature that we need to include at some point.

# TODOS / INFOS

Consider when writing the docs:

- what developer will see
- what user will see


DID registration is a Layer2 concept on the ledger. If they pay for it and it's fucked up, then that's all. BUT the state-machine is not affected.

TODO consider which cases need or not need Sybil attack protection and how different witness processes can defend against it.

# Hello

Take full control of your digital identity. Morpheus lets you create multiple independent private personas, letting you securely manage every aspect of your life.

IOP technology is open source and available for anyone to use or develop for. Although IOP is dedicated to providing a complete solution to the problems of online identity and privacy, IOP is fully modular and there is no lock in: users and businesses are free to use and combine whichever parts of the stack they want.
Find out more about our design philosophy and the IOP stack in our [white paper](https://iop.global/whitepaper/).

# TODOS / INFOS

Consider when writing the docs:
- what developer will see
- what user will see

DID registration is a Layer2 concept on the ledger. If they pay for it and it's fucked up, then that's all. BUT the state-machine is not affected.
TODO consider which cases need or not need Sybil attack protection and how different witness processes can defend against it.
